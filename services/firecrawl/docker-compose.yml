# Self-hosted Firecrawl for local web scraping
# Based on https://github.com/firecrawl/firecrawl/blob/main/SELF_HOST.md
#
# This provides local scrape, map, and search functionality.
# Note: stealth proxy is cloud-only (requires Fire-engine).
#
# The code automatically falls back to cloud stealth when local fails.
