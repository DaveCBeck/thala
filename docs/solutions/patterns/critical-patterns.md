# Critical Patterns - Required Reading

**Purpose:** High-severity patterns that all subagents must check before code generation. These represent learned mistakes that should never be repeated.

**Format:** Each entry uses ❌ WRONG vs ✅ CORRECT for quick scanning.

## How to Add Patterns

When a solution has `severity: critical` or `severity: high` and represents a pattern that:
- The system has made multiple times
- Is non-obvious but must be followed every time
- Affects foundational components (LangGraph, async, LLM calls)

Use the template at `.claude/skills/compound-docs/assets/critical-pattern-template.md` to add an entry here.
